-- 1: Filter customers by selected countries
-- Retrieve customers who are located in the UK, Canada, or France.
SELECT * FROM Prac2Tables.mysql_customers_table
WHERE country IN ('UK', 'Canada', 'France');


-- 2: Match transactions with existing customers (INNER JOIN)
-- Show only transactions that have a matching customer record.
SELECT t.transaction_id, t.customer_id, t.amount_usd, c.customer_id
FROM Prac2Tables.mysql_transactions_table AS t
INNER JOIN Prac2Tables.mysql_customers_table AS c
ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id;


-- 3: Keep all transactions, even without a customer match (LEFT JOIN)
-- Display every transaction and include customer data when available.
SELECT t.transaction_id, t.customer_id, t.transaction_datetime, t.amount_usd, c.customer_id
FROM Prac2Tables.mysql_transactions_table AS t
LEFT JOIN Prac2Tables.mysql_customers_table AS c
ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id;


-- 4: Keep all customers, even without transactions (RIGHT JOIN)
-- Display every customer and include transaction data when available.
SELECT t.transaction_id, t.customer_id, t.transaction_datetime, t.amount_usd, c.customer_id
FROM Prac2Tables.mysql_transactions_table AS t
RIGHT JOIN Prac2Tables.mysql_customers_table AS c
ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id;


-- 5: Create all possible customer–transaction combinations (CROSS JOIN)
-- Generate every possible pairing between customers and transactions.
-- This is useful for testing, simulations, or learning how joins behave.
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.country, t.customer_id
FROM Prac2Tables.mysql_customers_table AS c
CROSS JOIN Prac2Tables.mysql_transactions_table AS t;


-- 6: Standard join to combine customer and transaction data
-- Link customers to their transactions using a basic JOIN condition.
-- In MySQL, JOIN without a type defaults to INNER JOIN.
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.country, t.customer_id
FROM Prac2Tables.mysql_customers_table AS c
JOIN Prac2Tables.mysql_transactions_table AS t
ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id;
