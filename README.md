Overview

This repository has a set of SQL queries that I developed to showcase my real-world expertise with MySQL data exploration, analysis, and issue solving. This portfolio is to demonstrate how I use real-world datasets and SQL methods to obtain insightful information.
A different table or theme, such as movies, products, employees, customers, and date/time operations, is the emphasis of each file in this repository. When taken as a whole, they demonstrate both my technical development and my capacity to organize questions in an understandable and efficient way. 

What this portfolio shows 

In these projects I show skills such as:
- Data exploration using SELECT * and basic filtering
- Aggregation with COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY, and HAVING
- Conditional logic using CASE, IF, IFNULL, COALESCE, and NULLIF
- Subqueries and derived tables
- Window functions such as ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, DENSE_RANK
- String and text functions like CONCAT, REPLACE, LOCATE
- Date and time functions including DATE_ADD, DATE_SUB, DATEDIFF, and TIMESTAMPDIFF
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS) for combining multiple tables
- Set operations such as UNION
- Query optimization through clear structure and readable formatting

The Repository Structure

Each dataset is the focus of each SQL file, which includes:
- Multiple questions, ranging from basic to complex
- Short, expert comments outlining the functions of each query
- Realistic examples reflecting real business problems

Examples:

- de_spelen.sql – Olympic data exploration (Projetcs_Olympics)
- global_movies.sql – Movie performance and revenue analysis (GLOBAL_MOVIES)
- products.sql – Product categories and stock analysis (Producten.products)
- global_employees.sql – Employee salary and bonus insights (Global_Employee)
- world_people.sql – Demographics and income patterns (World_people) 
- datetime_practice.sql – Date and time functions (Date_Time) 
- joins_practice.sql – Working with multiple related tables ()

How to use this portfolio

Open any file in this repository that ends in.sql.
To understand the objective of each question, read the brief comment above it.
Run the queries in MySQL or another SQL environment that is compatible.
Examine the results to see how different SQL strategies are used.
I continue to practice by using this portfolio as a learning tool.

Why I built this project

I made this portfolio in order to improve my SQL skills while creating something useful and presentable. 
I organized them into specific files with short explanations instead of only practicing single queries. Now I can think more like a data analyst thanks to this method. This makes the questions easier to read and it establishes professional documentation practices.
I also feel more comfortable when working with structured datasets. 

Tools Used

The main tools I used were MySQL for query execution and testing. 
I used GitHub for version control and portfolio hosting. 

Final Note

This repository is a reflection of my SQL learning process. The queries show constant development and a keen interest in data analysis and managing databases, from basic to more complex ideas.
I thank you for taking the time to look at my work.
